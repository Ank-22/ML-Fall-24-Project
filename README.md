# Intraday Stock Forecasting: A Comparative Analysis of Advanced Machine Learning Models with Feature-Enriched Data Processing

**Project Overview**  
This research project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models specifically tailored for high-frequency stock price prediction, focusing on short-term forecasts over a 15-minute horizon. Precise, time-sensitive predictions are critical in high-frequency trading (HFT), where real-time insights are essential for rapid decision-making. Given the highly volatile nature of stock prices, influenced by both technical indicators and broader economic factors, this study seeks to design models capable of adapting effectively to these dynamic conditions.

The motivation for this project arises from a deep interest in data-driven decision-making and the practical application of machine learning in complex, fast-changing domains like financial markets. Building on foundational insights from coursework and exploring real-world trading applications, this study will conduct a comparative analysis of multiple algorithmsâ€”namely, XGBoost, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. By examining the strengths and limitations of each approach, we aim to enhance model selection and optimization strategies within high-frequency trading environments.
