# Intraday Stock Forecasting: A Comparative Analysis of Advanced Machine Learning Models with Feature-Enriched Data Processing

**Project Overview**  
This research project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models specifically tailored for high-frequency stock price prediction, focusing on short-term forecasts over a 15-minute horizon. Precise, time-sensitive predictions are critical in high-frequency trading (HFT), where real-time insights are essential for rapid decision-making. Given the highly volatile nature of stock prices, influenced by both technical indicators and broader economic factors, this study seeks to design models capable of adapting effectively to these dynamic conditions.

The motivation for this project arises from a deep interest in data-driven decision-making and the practical application of machine learning in complex, fast-changing domains like financial markets. Building on foundational insights from coursework and exploring real-world trading applications, this study will conduct a comparative analysis of multiple algorithmsâ€”namely, XGBoost, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. By examining the strengths and limitations of each approach, we aim to enhance model selection and optimization strategies within high-frequency trading environments.

## Safe Practices for Collaboration  
To maintain code quality and collaboration standards, we follow these practices:

- **Create a New Branch**: For each feature or fix, create a separate branch (e.g., `feature-xyz` or `bugfix-xyz`) rather than working directly on the `main` branch.
  
- **Avoid Direct Commits on Main**: Commit changes to the newly created branch. This keeps the `main` branch stable and minimizes the risk of unintentional errors.

- **Pull Request (PR) Reviews**: When a feature or fix is complete, open a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the `main` branch. Ensure the PR includes a description of changes, testing notes, and any specific requirements.

- **Request a Code Review**: Have at least one team member review your code before merging it into the main branch. Constructive feedback and approval from others help to catch potential issues and improve code quality.

- **Regular Pulls from Main**: Frequently pull the latest updates from `main` into your branch to avoid merge conflicts and ensure you are working with the most up-to-date code.

- **Write Meaningful Commit Messages**: Use clear and descriptive commit messages for each change. This makes it easier to track changes and understand the purpose of each commit.

- **Document Major Changes**: If your changes introduce new functionality, update the project documentation to reflect the modifications.

Following these practices will help us maintain a smooth and productive workflow.
