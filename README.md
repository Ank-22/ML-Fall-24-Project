# Intraday Stock Forecasting: A Comparative Analysis of Advanced Machine Learning Models with Feature-Enriched Data Processing

The primary objective of this research is to develop and evaluate machine learning models tailored for high-frequency stock price prediction, specifically targeting short-term forecasts over a 15-minute horizon. This time-sensitive prediction is crucial in high-frequency trading (HFT), where precise, real-time insights are essential for rapid decision-making. Given the volatile nature of stock prices, which are influenced by technical indicators and broader economic factors, this research seeks to design models that can adapt effectively to these dynamic conditions. The motivation for this project stems from an interest in data-driven decision-making and the practical application of machine learning in complex, fast-changing domains such as financial markets. Building on foundational insights from our coursework and exploring real-world trading applications, this study will conduct a comparative analysis of multiple algorithmsâ€”specifically, XGBoost, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. By examining the strengths and limitations of each approach, we aim to improve model selection and optimization strategies within high-frequency trading environments.
